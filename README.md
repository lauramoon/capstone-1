### Plant Quizzes

This repo contains the files for my first capstone project. It will be an app that provides quizzes to test the user's ability to recognize images of plants. See [proposal.md](proposal.md) for more details.

Information to create the quizzes will come from https://trefle.io/, which is an API that provides botanical data gathered from a variety of sources such as the USDA and Wikimedia.

The database schema for the project is [here](schema.PNG).
